FLOW NETWORK OPERATIONS
In graph theory, a flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge
receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge.
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in graph theory is used to calculate the maximum flow in water distribution
pipeline network. The maximum flow problem is one of the most fundamental problems in network
flow theory and has been investigated extensively. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a simple algorithm
to solve the maximum flow problem and based on the idea of searching augmenting path from a
started source node to a target sink node. It is one of the most widely used algorithms in optimization
of flow networks and various computer applications.
Scope of the project:
The project will facilitate the following: -
 Dynamic construction of a flow network through user input. User data will be fed into an
adjacency matrix to represent a directed weighted graph to resemble the flow network. Once
the user provides with the source and the sink nodes,
 A menu will be provided to perform different operations on the flow network.
1. Print all possible paths from source to destination (any node).
2. Maximum flow from source to sink using the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.
3. To find the minimum s-t cut (s-> source, t-> sink).
Technology used:
Programming language: C++
IDE: Code::Blocks
Data Structure: Directed Weighted Graph (represented through adjacency matrix)
